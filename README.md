Authors (@slack): Rahma Nabil (@rahmanabil2002)  

Transcriptomics is the study of structure, function, and evolution of transcriptome. What is transcriptome? It is a complete set of RNA (ribonucleic acid) transcripts expressed in some given entity such as a cell, tissue, or organism. Transcriptomics provides insights and regulation. It has been influenced by high-throughput sequencing technologies significantly, facilitating trough transcriptome analysis in a range of biological activities. 

### **importance of transcriptomics in biomarker discovery**

Transcriptomics is essential to the research for biomarker discovery by providing comprehensive insights into gene expression linked to a wide range of diseases. The identification and validation of transcriptomic signatures are advanced by the integration of advanced sequencing technologies and computational frameworks and this can greatly boost disease diagnosis and therapy stratification.

 About advances in transcriptomic technologies: the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the investigation of gene co-expression networks both essential for the discovery of biomarkers have been made possible by next-generation sequencing (NGS), which has completely transformed transcriptome research1,2.   
When analyzing complex biological samples, like saliva, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is beneficial since it may detect RNA markers that distinguish across different situations3.

About computational approaches: The emergence of annotation-agnostic techniques allows for the examination of unannotated RNAs, which might potentially function as new biomarkers, hence boosting the comprehensiveness of transcriptome research4.   
Integrating techniques such as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) with differential expression gene (DEG) analysis enhances the reliability of identifying biomarkers1.

Clinical Application: Transcriptomic profiling is crucial for comprehending complex disorders, including cancer, and facilitates the discovery of possible treatment targets4.

**Case Study: The Role of Transcriptomics in Biomarker Discovery for Breast Cancer**

Case description: An evaluation of the use of transcriptome data for the identification and validation of biomarkers, namely HER2 (ERBB2), estrogen receptor (ESR1), and androgen receptor (AR), was conducted on 57 patients with breast cancer. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were subjected to RNA profiling by NGS. RNA levels and progression-free survival (PFS) were the main focus of the investigation, which compared the outcomes of RNA profiling with those acquired using IHC and FISH.

### **Conclusion**

Transcriptomics provides thorough insights into gene expression in a variety of disorders, making it crucial for the development of biomarkers. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), an advanced technology that offers more precision and reliability than conventional approaches, has greatly improved biomarker discovery and validation. This breakthrough promotes the overall growth of personalized medicine and improves illness diagnosis, treatment strategies, and therapy stratification.
